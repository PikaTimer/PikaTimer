TODO for 1.5 Release

Bugs:
DONE: Ultra Direct: Discover only scans 1st network adapter
DONE: Ultra Direct: Save to file holds old target locations
DONE: FTPS Upload: Upload to a temp file and then do a rename to get around file locking issues
DONE: Text header/footer does not honor line feeds in text output files (search/replace \R for System.linefeed() )
DONE: Single quotes in split names causes issues in the JSON parsing. Need to wrap in double quotes and escape all double quotes in any user editable field (split, segment, name, city, state, country, etc)
DONE: Having the "in-progress" or "show dnf's" not checked during a race with no finishers yet results in problems in the OverallJSON that blows through the OverallHMTL5 report.
DONE: Awards are not populated on initial event creation
Start time lookup: 2nd location shows all waves and adds extra waves to those races
Ultra Direct: Better exception catching when we ask for a setting that we don't have an value for yet


Features:
DONE: Participant: Custom Attributes (string, integer, number, date, time, list)
DONE: Participant Import: Assign to race/wave based on an input field in the CSV file

DONE: Awards: Custom Awards:
        DONE: arbitrary order,

        DONE: group by (sex, age, age group), 
        DONE: skew by custom duration,
        DONE: depths (fixed, variable)
DONE: Awards: Hide on default awards report flag
DONE: Awards: Hide in overall results report flag

DONE: Split: Advanced toggle switch to enable additional options
DONE: Split: Min time to next split (under advanced display for the split)
DONE: Split: Cutoff time (times after this are OCO'ed)
DONE: Split: Cutoff time: Relative vs TOD
DONE: Split: "Pause" split time support (aka "dead zone" or "ignore"). Basically don't count this time against the final. 
DONE: Split: Mandatory split (stop if they are missing a time from the split)

DONE: Segment: Hidden flag (don't display on results)
DONE: Segment: Pace display (vs the global default)
