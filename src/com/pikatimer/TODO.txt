TODO for 1.5 Release

Bugs:
DONE: Ultra Direct: Discover only scans 1st network adapter
DONE: Ultra Direct: Save to file holds old target locations
DONE: FTPS Upload: Upload to a temp file and then do a rename to get around file locking issues
DONE: Text header/footer does not honor line feeds in text output files (search/replace \R for System.linefeed() )
DONE: Single quotes in split names causes issues in the JSON parsing. Need to wrap in double quotes and escape all double quotes in any user editable field (split, segment, name, city, state, country, etc)
DONE: Having the "in-progress" or "show dnf's" not checked during a race with no finishers yet results in problems in the OverallJSON that blows through the OverallHMTL5 report.
DONE: Awards are not populated on initial event creation
DONE: Ultra Direct: Better connection timeout handling
DONE: Start time lookup: Odd behavior at times. e.g. 2nd location shows all waves and adds extra waves to those races
Ultra Direct: Better exception catching when we ask for a setting that we don't have an value for yet
