Overall Focus: 
Cleanup UI and input field validation
Create a DurationTextField / LocalTimeTextField that "does the right thing"
Create a DurationCell (or whatever) for inline edits of durations?
editCell that does not revert on focus change (WTF Oracle)

-Fix Result object to calculate and keep split Properties that are based on the start time
-Fix the result object with a proper extractor for display in the tableview
-Fix result display to show wave start -> actual delta, gun time
-Fix result display to not freak on split changes (maybe a refresh button?)
-Backup times flag
-Ignore Chip Read flag (ignoring a cooked time is easy, propagating that to the raw is a bit harder)
-Mandatory split? (if it is mandatory)
-Force participant to the 1st wave of a given race if they are seen at a given timing 
location? (Good for start lines and really remote locations, but it could be trouble for post run spectators.)

ability to isolate a bib# for the search 
    (e.g., " 1234 " would only show 1234 and not 12345)

RFID Direct:
    --Continually import times from box (via tcp in a separate task) to a timing point
